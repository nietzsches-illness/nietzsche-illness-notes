# Autumn 1878: Weekly headaches

> We know little about Fritz’s three-week stay (4 September to 17 October) in
> Naumburg, where his mother had at last bought the corner house on the
> Weingartenstrasse (which she had previously been renting) and had had it
> enlarged to accommodate several rent-paying lodgers to cover the annual
> mortgage costs. Fritz’s health throughout his stay remained so delicate that
> arguments about Human, All Too Human were carefully avoided and visits from
> Naumburg friends discouraged.  In Basel, throughout the autumn-winter
> semester of 1878-79, Nietzsche continued to be plagued by headaches and
> paroxysmic seizures, recurring at weekly intervals, and even, towards the end
> of November, every three days. He needed all the fortitude he could muster to
> continue
