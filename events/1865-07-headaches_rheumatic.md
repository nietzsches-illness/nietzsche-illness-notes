# July 1865: Headaches rheumatic

> Nietzsche’s final weeks in Bonn were anything but happy. He was racked by
> rheumatic pains, toothache and splitting headaches, induced by drenching
> downpours and the Rhine valley’s unpleasantly humid, soggy climate. The last
> days were spent in a frenzy of letter-writing, trunk-filling
