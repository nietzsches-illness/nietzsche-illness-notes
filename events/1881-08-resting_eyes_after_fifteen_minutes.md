# Aug 1881: Resting eyes after fifteen minutes

> spent five or more hours walking through the dense pine forests. From 7 to 9
> p.m. he sat in the dark to give his eyes a rest — as he had done at Genoa
> where, as he wrote to his mother on 24 August, he was always back home ‘every
> evening without exception from six o'clock on; never theatre concerts, etc.
> You cannot imagine how thriftily, indeed how stingily I have to husband my
> intellectual powers and my time, so that such a suffering and imperfect being
> as myself can nonetheless bear ripe fruit..."  The ‘ripe fruit’ were five
> more ‘chapters’ (i.e. collections of aphorisms and brief essays) he wished to
> add as a second, follow-up volume to Morgenréte. He could not write for more
> than fifteen minutes at a time without having to lie down to rest his eyes.
> Forced to ration the time
