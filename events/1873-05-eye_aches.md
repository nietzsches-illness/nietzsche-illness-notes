# May 1873: Eye aches

> second university semester and the resumption of his tedious Padagogium
> classes, Nietzsche began to suffer blinding eye-aches which made it
> impossible for him to work at night by lamplight.  On 18 May Gersdorff
> reached Basel, after a brief stopover in Florence to see Malwida von
> Meysenbug. During his tour of Sicily Carl had contracted malaria, but the
> bouts of shivering fever and intestinal inconveniences it had caused him were
> mild compared to the blinding torments now affecting his friend Fritz, With
> each passing day Nietzsche's agonizing eye-aches grew more intense. By the
> time his sister Elisabeth reached Basel on 5 June, he could no longer read or
> write letters, even to close friends like Erwin Rohde, Cosima or Richard
> Wagner. He was forced to wear dark glasses every time he ventured out of the
> Schiitzengraben house, and much of his time was spent indoors in a room with
> the curtains carefully drawn to reduce the daylight to a minimum. If his
> friend Carl had not generously volunteered to stay on and help Fritz with the
> laborious writing, reading and correcting of the partly dictated manuscript,
> Nietzsche could never have finished his anti- Strauss polemic.
