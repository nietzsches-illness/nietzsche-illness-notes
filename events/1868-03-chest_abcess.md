# Mar 1868: Chest abcess

> The scholar-turned-cannoneer’s enthusiasm for riding soon got him into
> serious trouble. With the onset of spring, in mid-March of 1868, he and his
> fellow trainees were able to leave the ring and gallop their horses around
> the large exercise ground. As the ablest rider among the new recruits,
> Nietzsche was given the most unruly of the battery’s horses to mount.
> Mastering this nervous steed was not easy, particularly during jumping
> practice, as the novice horseman soon discovered. Unbalanced by his fiery
> charger’s sudden spurt in going for a jump, he ended up on the horse’s neck,
> his chest hitting the pommel of the saddle with fall force. He went on riding
> as though nothing had happened, despite the pain he felt on one side of his
> ribcage and in the centre of his chest. But the next day he fainted twice and
> had to be put to bed. The following morning he could hardly move his arm,
> while the throbbing in the middle of his chest was agony. His chest was
> bandaged, cold compresses were applied to his feverish forehead, and in the
> evening he was given morphine for the pain.  After ten days of acute
> suffering, the local doctors finally decided to make some surgical incisions
> in the centre of his hideously inflamed chest. From it they drew several
> cupfuls of infected pus. This crude operation brought the sufferer
> considerable relief, making it possible for Nietzsche
