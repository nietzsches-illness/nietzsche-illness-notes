# Oct 1857: Headaches

> At the Naumburg Domgymnasium the obedient, hard-working Friedrich Nietzsche
> moved up steadily from year to year. But shortly after his thirteenth
> birthday on 15 October 1857, which brought him a new crop of Beethoven scores
> (gifts from Gustav Krug and Wilhelm Pinder), he began to suffer from blinding
> headaches — an affliction that was to plague him on and off for the rest of
> his life. His mother, alarmed by the strain to which he had put his eyes by
> working long hours in the evening by weak oil-lamp or candlelight, kept him
> at home and away from the Domgymnasium until the pains had subsided — with
> the result that Fritz skipped most of a semester.
