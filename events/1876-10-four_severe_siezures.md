# Oct 1876: Four severe siezures

> On Saturday, 28 October, Cosima reported having seen Malwida, whose birthday
> it was, but there was no mention of Nietzsche. Two days later Cosima took her
> children to the Villa Rubinacci, while Wagner remained behind at the Hotel
> Vittoria. Again there was no mention of Nietzsche. He may have succumbed to
> one of four severe seizures he suffered during his first fortnight in
> Sorrento. This would explain why on
