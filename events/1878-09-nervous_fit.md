# Sept 1878: Nervous fit

> An even longer walk took Nietzsche through Basel and on northwards to the
> village of LÃ©rrach, where his delight at being received with open arms by the
> warm-hearted Marie Baumgartner was so emotionally upsetting that it
> precipitated another nervous fit: one so serious that he had to send a
> telegram to Franz Overbeck in Ziirich announcing a delay in his arrival.
