# Feb 1876: Relapse painful

> In early February Fritz’s spirits rose when he learned that Erwin Rohde had
> been appointed full professor of philology at Jena. But this good news,
> tempered by Erwin’s passing reference to his ‘unlucky’ damsel (who had just
> given birth to a baby boy!), failed to impede another relapse, so
> paralysingly painful that for days Nietzsche could neither read nor write.
