# Oct 1877: Eiser eyes treatment

> In early October Nietzsche finally yielded to the entreaties of Dr Otto
> Eiser, who in several letters had insisted that he come to Frankfurt as his
> house-guest and undergo a ‘thorough examination’ of his eyes. In Frankfurt he
> was carefully examined not only by Dr Eiser, but also by an eye specialist,
> Dr Gustav Kriiger. The gist of the report that Eiser sent to Basel on 6
> October was that Nietzsche’s headaches and nervous seizures (he even used the
> word ‘paroxysms’) were primarily caused by the eyes and irritation of the
> optic nerve. A ‘careful application’ of ‘galvanic currents’ could be
> recommended, but all remedies of a ‘heroic kind’ (such as clysters, etc.)
> were to be avoided. Particularly dire was the stern prescription, underlined
> to stress its capital importance: an absolute avoidance of reading and
> writing for years to come. Blue-lensed spectacles were recommended by Dr
> Gustav Kriiger, and, in general, the patient should avoid ‘every form of
> extreme physical and intellectual exertion’.
