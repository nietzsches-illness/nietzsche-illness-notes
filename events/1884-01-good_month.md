# Jan 1884: Good month

> January — the ‘Sanctus Januarius’ which two years before had inspired the
> fourth and final part of The Joyous Science, and one year later the first
> volume of his Zarathustra, once again proved to be a ‘blessed’ month — thanks
> to Nice’s bright blue, cloudless skies. On 18 January 1884
