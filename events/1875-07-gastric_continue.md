# July 1875: Gastric continue

> If Fritz had followed his friend Carl’s advice, had returned to Flims and
> resumed the simple milk-cure régime he had adopted two years before, he might
> have overcome this latest crisis and been able to make it to Bayreuth. But
> the humble village of Flims unfortunately did not boast a medical expert in
> stomach upsets. Instead, when the summer vacation began on 16 July,
> Nietzsche, meekly bowing to Immermann’s wishes, boarded a train bound for the
> Black Forest town of Bonndorf, near which, in a kind of forest clearing at
> Steinabad, a Dr Wiel ran a hotel-clinic for persons suffering from gastric
> abnormalities.
