# Oct 1877: Paroxysmic relapse

> The stark implications of this medical report were so shattering that they
> unleashed in Nietzsche, long obsessed by the feeling that he was slowly going
> blind, a major paroxysmic relapse. In the letter accom- panying Dr Eiserâ€™s
> detailed report, which he sent on 17 October to Carl Burckhardt, the new
> chairman of the university's governing council, Nietzsche asked to be
> exonerated from all further teaching obligations at the Padagogium.
