# Sept 1870: Diptheria dysentery

> For three hellish days and nights, during which he hardly slept a wink,
> Nietzsche had to feed and water his groaning charges, unbandage and rebandage
> their wounds, and try to relieve their suffering as best he could. At
> Karlsruhe the wounded soldiers were unloaded on to stretchers and carted off
> to a field hospital. Nietzsche by this time was so ill and exhausted that he
> could barely make it back by train to Erlangen, where he and Mosengel had to
> report to their superiors. An examining physician found that Nietzsche in his
> turn had contracted diphtheria as well as dysentery. He was consigned to his
> bed at the HÃ©tel Wallfisch, and for the next two weeks Mosengel looked after
> him, gradually nursing him back to health with opium, tannin and other enema
> ablutions.
