# Jan 1877: Six good weeks

> On 1 February, Paul Rée, who had dutifully been supplementing Nietzsche’s
> laconic postcards with longer letters to Naumburg to keep his mother and
> sister informed of Fritz’s health and activities, wrote to say that the past
> six weeks had been exceptionally good, with but two bad days.
