> His euphoria was short-lived. The radiant weather, which had enabled him to
> enjoy fourteen consecutive nights of sleep, again turned wet and cold,
> plunging him back into an ‘abyss’ of despair so dark and deep that, as he
> wrote to Franz Overbeck on 10 February, he was persuaded that he had not long
> to live and was almost ready to take his life with a pistol.
