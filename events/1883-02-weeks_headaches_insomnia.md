# Feb 1883: Weeks headaches insomnia

> His return to his old lodgings in Genoa brought Nietzsche no immediate relief
> from his migraine, stomach upsets and insomnia. So weakened by weeks of
> nervous sleeplessness was his normally robust constitution that he came down
> with a severe attack of influenza, which Genoa’s ‘best doctor’ undertook to
> combat with daily doses of quinine. In
