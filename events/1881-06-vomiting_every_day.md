# June 1881: Vomiting every day

> By the time Nietzsche left Recoaro, on 25 or 26 June, he was suffering from
> paroxysmic seizures and vomiting every day. But he had no choice in the
> matter: it was a matter of life — the several more years he needed to
> complete his philosophical ‘mission’ — or death brought on by suicide in the
> darkest moment of depression. He was in no condition to travel, but travel he
> did. Once again the trip was agony, aggravated by a missed train connection,
> which almost doubled the travel time as well as the cost.
