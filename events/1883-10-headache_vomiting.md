# Oct 1883: Headache vomiting

> Early in October Fritz said goodbye to his mother and sister and took the
> train to Frankfurt, where he ran into Ida and Franz Overbeck, who were
> returning from a visit to relatives in Dresden. They had not been travelling
> for much more than an hour on the southbound train when Nietzsche suffered a
> nervous seizure, with splitting headaches and nausea, and had to dismount at
> Freiburg and drag himself to a hotel, where he spent a miserable night
> vomiting up his entrails. The next morning he continued manfilly on to Basel
> where, crippled by a violent headache, he spent an entire day in the bedroom
> that the hospitable Overbecks were always happy to have him use.
