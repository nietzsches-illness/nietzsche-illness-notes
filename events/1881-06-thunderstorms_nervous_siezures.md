> standards, was unusually hot, with successive thunderstorms, each of which
> laid him low with another nervous seizure. August was no better, with
> dramatic changes of temperature and, in the middle of the month, a wintry
> snowfall and such an onset of cold that in his small, unheated, pine-walled
> room Nietzsche suffered a chilblained finger and had to write to his mother
> and sister in Naumburg, begging them to send him a pair of gloves and thick
> woollen stockings. In a letter written to
