# Aug 1876: Eyesight eye pain headaches

> of suicidal despair. Having a companion to help him was an elementary travel
> precaution, for Nietzsche’s eyesight had by now so deteriorated that he could
> hardly see. The drastic treatment prescribed by his ophthal- mologist,
> Professor Schiess — atropine eyedrops, derived from the deadly nightshade
> plant — seems to have aggravated rather than alleviated the head- and eye-
> aches, and to have been equally ineffective in warding off the serious
> relapses, which now recurred with painful regularity every eight to ten days.
