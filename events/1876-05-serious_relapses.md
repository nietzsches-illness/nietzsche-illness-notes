# May 1876: Serious relapses

> On 29 March Carl said goodbye to his friend Fritz, who had decided to stay on
> as the Veytaux pension’s only client. The less than cheering news Gersdorff
> brought to Franziska and Elisabeth Nietzsche during his brief stopover in
> Basel was that Fritz had not yet recovered his good health and had suffered
> several serious relapses. So concerned was Gersdorff that he wrote several
> letters on the subject to Franz Overbeck, who had gone to Ziirich to spend
> the inter-semester holidays with his fiancée.
