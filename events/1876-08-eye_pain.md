# Aug 1876: Eye pain

> To judge from two letters later written by Elisabeth, Fritz, during his two
> weeks in Bayreuth, where the mid-August temperature mercifully cooled,
> greatly enjoyed himself in the company of his closest friends, even though
> his eyes continued to cause him pain, So too did Erwin Rohde who, emboldened
> by his recent betrothal, ‘turned on the charm’ and paid outlandish
> compliments to every lady he met.
