# Jan 1862: Headaches

> The year 1862 was with little doubt the most creative of the six years
> Friedrich Nietzsche spent at Pforta. But it began badly for the chronically
> afflicted migraine-sufferer, who experienced five bad days in January and an
> even longer spell of blinding headaches in February â€” enough to send him back
> to the sickroom, where once again he was bled by leeches.  In addition to
> rheumatic and arthritic pains brought on by the wintry cold, Nietzsche was
> probably affected by an intense inner crisis which had been steadily building
> up inside him. He was no longer the ardent
