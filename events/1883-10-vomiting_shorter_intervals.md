# Oct 1883: Vomiting shorter intervals

> Eight days later he travelled back to Genoa, where his old room was now free.
> But, as he wrote to Heinrich Késelitz on 22 October, his nervous seizures
> were recurring at ever shorter intervals, leaving him utterly exhausted and
> depressed. On a postcard sent that same day to his mother and sister, Fritz
> wrote that he had taken up temporary residence in Genoa, until he could find
> someone to accompany him to Spain. Italy, from Spezia southwards, was
> impossible — because of the sirocco.
