# Dec 1884: Torment

> The New Year season — this time from 1884-5 — was, as had so often happened
> in the past, a prolonged torment for Nietzsche with repeated vomiting caused
> by poor weather and the standard pension fare. ‘Someone get me a cook!’ he
> sighed in a letter to his mother and sister. He was fed
