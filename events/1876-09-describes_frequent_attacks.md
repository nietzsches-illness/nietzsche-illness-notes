# Sep 1876: Describes frequent attacks

> On 23 September, Wagner had sent Nietzsche a terse telegram from Venice,
> asking him to have two pairs of silk waistcoats and trousers sent to him by
> express delivery to Bologna by his favourite tailor in Basel. In the long
> reply he had dictated to Heinrich Késelitz, Nietzsche said how pleased he had
> been by Wagner's urgent request, so reminiscent of the ‘errands’ he and
> Cosima had often imposed on him during the lovely Tribschen years. ‘I now
> have time to look back over the past, distant as well as close, for I do a
> lot of sitting in a dark room, because of an atropine-cure for the eyes which
> it was felt I needed after my return home.’ The rest of this letter contained
> a pathetic description of Nietzsche’s nervous seizures, some of them lasting
> for thirty agonizing hours and recurring regularly at intervals of four to
> eight days. ‘Complete rest, mild air, walks, dark rooms — that is what I
> expect from Italy; I dread having to see or hear anything there.’ By which he
> meant anything resembling operas or plays.

a climax again; it is really the highest time: my authorities know what they
are doing when they give me a whole year's leave, although this sacrifice is
disproportionately large for such a small community; they would lose me in one
way or another if they didn't give me this escape; in the last few years,
thanks to the forbearance of my temperament, I have swallowed pain after pain,
as if I was born for that and nothing more. I have practically paid my tribute
in abundance to the philosophy that this teaches. This neuralgia proceeds so
thoroughly, so scientifically, it formally probes to what limit I can endure
pain, and always takes itself thirty hours for this examination. Every four to
eight days I must expect a repetition of this study: you see, it is the illness
of a scholar; but now I am sick of it, and I want to live healthily or not live
at all. Complete rest, mild air, walks, dark rooms – that is what I expect from
Italy;
