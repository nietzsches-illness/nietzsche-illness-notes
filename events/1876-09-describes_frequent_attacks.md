# Sep 1876: Describes frequent attacks

> On 23 September, Wagner had sent Nietzsche a terse telegram from Venice,
> asking him to have two pairs of silk waistcoats and trousers sent to him by
> express delivery to Bologna by his favourite tailor in Basel. In the long
> reply he had dictated to Heinrich Késelitz, Nietzsche said how pleased he had
> been by Wagner's urgent request, so reminiscent of the ‘errands’ he and
> Cosima had often imposed on him during the lovely Tribschen years. ‘I now
> have time to look back over the past, distant as well as close, for I do a
> lot of sitting in a dark room, because of an atropine-cure for the eyes which
> it was felt I needed after my return home.’ The rest of this letter contained
> a pathetic description of Nietzsche’s nervous seizures, some of them lasting
> for thirty agonizing hours and recurring regularly at intervals of four to
> eight days. ‘Complete rest, mild air, walks, dark rooms — that is what I
> expect from Italy; I dread having to see or hear anything there.’ By which he
> meant anything resembling operas or plays.
