# Aug 1882: Light sensitive eyes

> Lou would remain in Nietzsche’s ground-floor bedroom talking and debating
> until midnight, with her red scarf casually wound around the lampshade on his
> little table to shield his sensitive eyes — much to the annoyance of Herr
> Hahnemann, the farmer, who had to escort her back to the vicarage when he
> would have preferred to be in bed for another brief night of sleep before
> rising at dawn for the harvest.
