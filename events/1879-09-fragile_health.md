> several drawings, could not offer him enough space for his daily walks. On 11
> September he sent Késelitz a long letter, announcing the dispatch of a new
> manuscript which, lacking the strength and courage to do the job himself, he
> asked his ‘disciple’ to transcribe into a more legible script. For the time
> being he would not be coming to Venice. His still fragile state of  health
> led him to believe that he could best be cared for by his mother in Naumburg.
