# June 1882: Serious deterioration

> Tt was all very well to have sent Lou a copy of Human, All Too Human as an
> inspiring example of just how bold and iconoclastic he could be. For in
> Naumburg his health had seriously deteriorated, and as he confessed to Lou,
> ‘I very much need mountains and high forests: not only my health, but even
> more “die frdhliche Wissenschaft” [ Joyous Science] are driving me into
> solitude. I want to finish it.’ Would she therefore object if he now headed
> for Salzburg (or Berchtesgaden) before moving on to Vienna?
