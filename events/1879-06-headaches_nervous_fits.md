# June 1879: Headaches nervous fits

> Mixed Opinions and Maxims. Before he knew it, he had filled six small
> notebooks and run out of pencils. The excitement generated by these feverish
> moments was aggravated by the excruciating efforts he later had to make to
> develop these sudden illuminations into intelligible arguments and aphorisms:
> efforts which regularly brought on blinding headaches and nervous fits.
