# Mar 1879: More torture than recovery

> Not until 30 March, after the sun had reappeared in a bright sky reflected in
> the sparkling blue waters of the lake, did his spirits begin to rise — even
> though, as he wrote to his mother and sister, so far he had known ‘more
> torture than recovery. If only I could be master of my stomach!’ His life,
> ‘on the edge of the abyss’, he added, was ‘three quarters pain and one
> quarter exhaustion!”  These fits of nausea and vomiting were almost certainly
> psychosomatic symptoms of nervous anxiety over his friends’ reactions to his
> new book.
