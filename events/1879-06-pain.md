# June 1879: Pain

> Nietzsche's next destination was Wiesen, a village near Davos (1,450 metres
> above sea-level) which had been recommended to him by Késelitz’s friend Paul
> Widemann. ‘Pain, loneliness, walks, bad weather — such is my daily round,’ he
> wrote on a postcard sent to Franz Overbeck on 8 June. ‘No trace of
> excitement. Rather, a kind of unthinking, dazed feeling-rottenness’ —
> aggravated by the jarring news (from Schmeitzner) that so far no more than
> 120 copies of Human, All Too Human had been sold.
