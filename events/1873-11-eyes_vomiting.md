# Winter 1873: Eyes vomiting

> Throughout the autumn and early winter of 1873 Nietzsche was almost
> permanently unwell, suffering not only from acute eye-aches every time he
> tried to read for more than an hour or two, but also from nausea, stomach
> upsets and even vomiting — almost certainly due to his hyper- nervous
> condition in moments of difficult creativity. As his doctor friend, Professor
> Immermann, one day said to him, knowing in advance that it was an impossible
> prescription: ‘Be more stupid and you will feel better.’
