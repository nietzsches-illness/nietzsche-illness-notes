# Feb 1877: One eye shimmer opth exam

> Unfortunately, one of Nietzsche's eyes had suddenly become even more short-
> sighted, with an impression of ‘shimmering’ which caused the letters on any
> page before him to ‘collide’ and to form into lumps. Though Rée was persuaded
> that this was the result of a cold, his friend had been forced to give up all
> kinds of reading and writing.  At the suggestion of his Basel
> ophthalmologist, Heinrich Spiess, Nietzsche travelled to Naples, where his
> eyes were examined by a Professor Schrén, from the university’s medical
> faculty. He returned to Sorrento almost in high spirits, convinced, as he
> wrote to his mother and sister on 18 February, that Sorrento had a well-
> established reputation as an ideal place for eye cures. Professor Schrén had
> subjected him to the first truly meticulous examination he had ever
> undergone, had dismissed as nonsense the idea that he might be suffering from
> Kopfkatarrh (‘head- catarrh’, one of his sister’s favourite notions), and had
> given him a clearer idea of the origin of the trouble — though what this was
> Fritz did not tell his mother.  The Mediterranean sun had by this time
> disappeared, and for most of the next five weeks Sorrento was lashed by
> fierce winds and rain, while the summit of Vesuvius turned white with snow.
> ‘If only I could believe that things were gradually getting better,’ he wrote
> to his mother on 26 March. ‘But the very serious condition of the eye has
> gone, that is good.”
