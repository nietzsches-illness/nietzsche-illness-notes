# Jan 1883: Headaches vomiting

> Climatic factors again played a major role in this amazing resurgence. During
> the first two weeks of January 1883 Rapallo was so lashed by wintry gales and
> rain that never in his life had Nietzsche felt so frozen as in his small,
> seaside albergo. He was forced to spend much of his time in bed, racked by
> blinding headaches and fits of vomiting. His nights and days were haunted by
> ghastly memories of the humiliations recently inflicted on him — first, by
> his mother, with her reproach that he had ‘disgraced his father’s tomb’, then
> by a brazen ‘adventuress’, Lou Salomé, who used ideas as others use crossword
> puzzles for purposes of mental stimulation and amusement.
