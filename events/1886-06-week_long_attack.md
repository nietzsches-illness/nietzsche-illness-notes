# June 1886: Week long attack

> For one whole week, during which the temperature soared to 30° Celsius in the
> shade, Nietzsche suffered agonies in the normally cool bedroom he once again
> rented from the schoolteacher Herr Janicaud, near Leipzig’s Rosenthal Park.
> This was a physical torment he had feared and was consequently prepared for.
> What surprised and dismayed him was the distraught behaviour of Erwin Rohde,
> who had rashly chosen to leave
