# March 1882: Vomiting headaches

> Two days later Nietzsche sent a postcard to Rée, first to thank him for
> having more than reimbursed him for the travel fare to Rome, secondly to
> report that the typewriter, for baffling reasons, was no longer working as it
> should, and finally to admit that he had just spent several wretched days
> (headaches, vomiting, etc.). ‘Ah, this damned cloud-electricity!’ he
> lamented. ‘Should I really be crazy enough to approach the mountains again?’
> he asked, clearly thinking of Pieve di Cadore, in the foothills of the
> Dolomites. ‘Life by the seaside is what for me is easiest to endure. But
> where is the sea-spot that has enough shade for me! é una miseria!”
