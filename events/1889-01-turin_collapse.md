# Jan 1889: Turin collapse

> The climax in his odd behaviour was soon reached with a strange incident that
> took place on one of Turin’s streets. On seeing a cart-driver furiously
> beating his lagging nag, Nietzsche ran forward and flung his arms around the
> horse’s neck. Exactly what happened thereafter we shall probably never know,
> for the first printed account of this incident did not appear until thirteen
> years later in an Italian newspaper. But someone, it seems, hurried over to 6
> Via Carlo Alberto to inform Davide Fino that something had happened to il
> professore tedesco, that a crowd had gathered, and could he come as quickly
> as possible and bring him ‘home’?
