# Sep 1882: Head eye pain

> The next day Nietzche sent a postcard to his mother, giving her his new
> address in Leipzig. He had suffered a major migraine attack, two sleepless
> nights, and severe eye-aches, but despite the strains of apartment-hunting,
> he had managed to overcome his physical woes and was now lodged with a
> schoolteacher named Janicaud, who lived near the suburban Rosenthal park,
