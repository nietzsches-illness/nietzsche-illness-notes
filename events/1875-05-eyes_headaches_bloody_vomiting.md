# May 1875: Eyes headaches bloody vomiting

> assure the series a profitable regularity, had a shattering effect on
> Nietzsche, unleashing a psychosomatic crisis of extreme gravity. For the next
> six weeks, despite the consoling presence of his sister, he suffered acute
> eye-aches and headaches, and convulsive stomach upsets, some of them so
> protracted that blood came up with the vomit.  Nietzsche’s friend, Professor
> Immermann, seemed to be at his wits’ end as to how to deal with this new
> crisis, which could not be attributed to cerebral over-excitation during a
> tense period of literary creativity. He began by prescribing the daily
> absorption of a sinister ‘Héllenstein’ solution — the latest ‘miracle drug’
> in the apothecaries’ arsenal — and when this treatment failed to work
> wonders, the frustrated professor prescribed massive doses of quinine. One
> shudders in imagining the acute abdominal spasms that this traitement de
> cheval must have generated in ‘attacking’ Nietzsche’s stomach ulcers. The
> vomiting, sometimes going on for hours on end, was often so convulsive that
> Nietzsche felt that his last hour had come and yearned for nothing so much as
> a quick, ‘easeful death’.  On 28 June, after receiving a letter from Fritz
> describing his nightmarish HGllenstein and quinine ‘cure’, Carl von Gersdorff
> wrote to his friend in Basel: ‘I don’t wish to shake your confidence in the
> medical treatment but it nonetheless sounds to me as though I[{mmermann] has
> been experimenting dangerously with your poor stomach. For quinine I wish you
> a good appetite . . .’
