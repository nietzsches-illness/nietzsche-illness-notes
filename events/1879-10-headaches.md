# Oct 1879: Headaches

> On 18 October Nietzsche took his new manuscript to Leipzig, where he met
> Ernst Schmeitzner and his friend the musician Paul Widemann at the Stadt Rom
> café. Their lively conversation brought Nietzsche up to date on the latest
> goings-on in Bayreuth, where the pliant ‘wash-rag’, Hans von Wolzogen,
> continued to edit the increasingly antisemitic Bayreuther Blatter. But so
> mentally stimulated was Nietzsche by this enjoyable encounter that his
> headaches returned with a vengeance, forcing him to spend the night in a
> hotel room and most of the following Sunday stretched out limply on a sofa.
