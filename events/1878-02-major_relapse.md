# Feb 1878: Major relapse

> Nietzsche’s waning hopes of finding an effective cure for his headaches and
> nervous seizures were revived in early February 1878 by the arrival in Basel
> of a new professor of pathology and therapy named Rudolf Massini. With the
> professor's emphatic endorsement, Nietzsche reqested and obtained the
> university governing council’s consent to be permanently relieved of all
> further teaching obligations at the Padagogium: a dis- pensation (reducing
> his academic workload from twelve to six hours a week) which would make it
> possible for him to continue his university lecturing and seminar work. Even
> so he suffered another major relapse towards the end of the month — one so
> serious that he had to interrupt his lectures and undertake one more ‘cure’,
> this time at the famous Black Forest spa of Baden Baden.
