# Sept 1881: Ten ok days in three months

> In the last letter addressed from Sils-Maria to Heinrich KGselitz, on the eve
> of his return to Genoa on 22 September, Nietzsche wrote that the past three
> months had been dangerous times during which ‘Death stared down on me, I
> suffered terribly all summer long. Whereto should I [now] turn! That a sky
> with long months of purity has become a vital requirement for me, I now fully
> realize . . . Just think, in all, up here, I have had 10 endurable days, and
> the bad days brought me woes as ghastly as any I  suffered in Basel.’ The
> uncomfortable downhill trip from the Alpine highlands to Genoa  was once
> again prolonged agony, which left Nietzsche so weakened that not until 4
> October (five days after his departure from Sils-Maria) could he muster the
> strength to send a postcard to his mother and sister, saying that he had made
> it safely to the great seaport. In Genoa he was suffering, but in a way that
> made it “humanly possible” to live, whereas life in the  Engadine had been
> sheer ‘cruelty to animals . . . I can live only near the : Jverbec! » was
> back ‘in my city of Genoa
