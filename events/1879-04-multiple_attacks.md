# Apr 1879: Multiple attacks

> So basically unaltered was Nietzsche’s condition when he returned ten days
> later to ‘abominable, detrimental Basel, where I lost my health and shall
> lose my life!’ (as he put it in a letter to his mother and sister) — with one
> paroxysmic fit following hard on another — that he was unable to deliver his
> first scheduled lecture. On 2 May Nietzsche dictated a letter adressed to the
> chairman of the university’s governing council, asking to be relieved of all
> further academic responsibilities. The request was endorsed by his
> ophthalmologist, Professor Heinrich Schiess, and backed up by a letter from
> Rudolf Massini, in which the professor of pathology and therapy certified
> that Nietzsche was incapable of continuing his lectures.
