# Apr 1882: Rome nearly always in bed

> eyes can one see that he has lost his power of sight.’ Two days later Malwida
> wrote again to her foster-daughter in Paris to say that Nietzsche had
> returned to the villa and spent three hours talking to her. She had been
> amazed to discover how ‘fresh and eternally effervescent’ was his mind,
> despite his sufferings. ‘He has spent almost his whole time here in bed, and
> has seen nothing of Rome save for the Villa Mattei and St Peter's.’
