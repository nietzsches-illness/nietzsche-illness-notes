# Jun 1877: Relapse

> The three and a half weeks spent at Ragaz were anything but happy,
> notwithstanding the invigorating mountain air, plenty of pine forests, and
> the standard water-cure prescriptions of a local doctor. On 6 June, after
> suffering a three-day relapse partly due to the oppressive heat, Nietzsche
> wrote to Malwida von Meysenbug that he was moving up into ‘the heights’ — to
> an isolated village with the charmingly Helvetian name of Rosenlauibad,
> perched on the northern flank of the great Bernese
