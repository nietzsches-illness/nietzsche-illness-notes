# Apr 1882: Day in bed

> Such was the situation when Nietzsche reached the Eternal City, so nervously
> upset and exhausted by the rhythmic pounding of the railway- carriage wheels
> beneath him that, on reaching his albergo, he had to spend the rest of the
> day in bed. The next day, 26 April, he turned up at the Villa Mattei, on the
> Via della Polveriera, where Malwida von Meysenbug was
