# Apr 1887: State of prostration

> Emmanuele, Nietzsche left the no longer ‘idyllic’ haven of Canobbio on 28
> April and headed northward via Bellinzona and the St Gotthard tunnel to
> Ziirich. He reached the sultry lakeside city that evening in such a state of
> prostration that he barely had strength enough to drag himself and his
> luggage to the Pension Neptun. On Friday, 29 April, he wrote a pathetic
> letter to Franz Overbeck in Basel. He was suffering terribly from the ‘slack,
> flabby’ air and a painful excess of sunshine, and his repeated fits
