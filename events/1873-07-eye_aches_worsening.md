# July 1873: Eye aches worsening

> By early July Nietzscheâ€™s condition had deteriorated so drastically that his
> doctor friend, Professor Immermann, told him that he would have to cease his
> Padagogium classes before the end of the school year and undergo a cure of
> total rest in some secluded mountain village. On or around 7 July, Fritz and
> his friend Carl left Basel and headed south-eastward past
