# July 1884: Headaches vomiting

> With a spartan rigour which never ceased to amaze his landlord-grocer,
> Nietzsche would get up every morning when the faintly dawning sky was still
> grey, and, after washing himself with cold water from the pitcher and china
> basin in his bedroom and drinking some warm milk, he would, when not felled
> by headaches and vomiting, work uninterruptedly until eleven in the morning.
> He then went for a brisk, two-hour walk through

[@cate2005friedrich, p. 451]
