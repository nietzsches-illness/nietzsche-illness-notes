# Jan 1861: Headaches rheumatism

> In terms of physical well-being the late winter of 1861 was once again a
> season of suffering for Nietzsche. In mid-January his headaches, this time
> induced by rheumatism of the neck, returned with a vengeance. Finally
> yielding to the advice of his benevolent tutor Robert Buddensieg, he retired
> to the Pforta sickroom. Here leeches were applied to his earlobes and he was
> bled, in the belief that this standard cure (for almost every ailment) would
> work wonders. All it did was to aggravate the impatient sufferer's desire to
> escape from this rÃ©gime of enforced idleness by being allowed to go for long
> walks in the nearby woods. Scholastic diligence as well as migraine-enduring
> fortitude enabled him to make up for lost study-time, and once again he came
> out of the end-of-semester exams in March at the head of his class. A Latin
> essay he wrote some weeks later
