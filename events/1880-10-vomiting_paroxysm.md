# Oct 1880: Vomiting paroxysm

> On 31 August Nietzsche finally left Marienbad for Naumburg. During the five
> weeks he spent with his mother and sister, he was unusually sullen and
> morose; and, as he later wrote to Késelitz, not once during his stay in his

> his family on 15 October. But one week before, he abruptly decided to leave
> for the ‘sunny south’ (Italy) before the onset of the autumn cold. The result
> of this impetuous decision was another nerve- racking trip. By the time the
> train reached Frankfurt, he was vomiting. Farther south at Heidelberg he had
> to interrupt his journey and spend a day and night in bed. In Basel he spent
> a few refreshing hours with his dear friends Franz and Ida Overbeck, but the
> respite was brief. During the trip through the Gotthard tunnel he suffered a
> major paroxysmic fit and had to spend three days in rainswept Locarno trying
> to recover. At Stresa, near
