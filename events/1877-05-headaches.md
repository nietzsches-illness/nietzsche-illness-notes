# May 1877: Headaches

> In his hotel bedroom, still wracked by headaches, he barely had strength
> enough to scribble a brief thank-you note to Reinhart von Seydlitz: ‘“He had
> aes triplex [triple bronze] around his chest, who for the first time
> travelled on the sea,” says Horace; I had only aurum triplex {triple gold];
> that’s how horrible it was! Today [I’m] a broken man in all respects; morally
> too, for I am visibly distrustful, keep every moment counting my belongings,
> suspect my fellow creatures, and can’t properly imagine that the sun is
> shining down on me — which is also not the case.’
