> few weeks, did little to reduce Nietzsche’s nervousness over the final state
> of his new book. From early February of 1879 on, his violent headaches were
> accompanied by a cramp which forced him to keep his right eye closed for
> hours at a time. The steady deterioration in his health made it more and more
> difficult for him to complete his weekly quota of five lectures and one
> seminar hour. In early March he suffered a major shock when he discovered
> that, without asking his permission, Schmeitzner had used the last two pages
> of Mixed Opinions and Maxims to advertise Paul Rée’s The Origin of Moral
> Sentiments with a sentence of rash praise lifted from one of Nietzsche's
> letters to the publisher. This contretemps and a few glaring errors made by
> the typesetters unleashed several severe scizutes, forcing him to cease all
> his lectistes:
