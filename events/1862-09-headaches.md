# Sept 1862: Headaches

> compositions into a Lisztian mould. This may explain a new bout of violent
> headaches to which he succumbed a fortnight after his return to Pforta. After
> a week spent in the sickroom he persuaded the school doctor to let him go to
> Naumburg for a few days of total rest, during which he stoically denied
> himself all forms of musical and intellectual stimulation. The cure seems to
> have worked. There was in any case little time left over
