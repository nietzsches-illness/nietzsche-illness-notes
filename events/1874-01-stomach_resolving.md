# Jan 1874: Stomach resolving

> In Naumburg two weeks of maternal care and a simple diet, beginning every
> morning with warm cow’s milk (the best remedy for his frequent stomach upsets
> and ulcerous condition), had greatly helped to calm his nerves. In Basel
> Fritz gave up his habit of lunching at a nearby tavern, offering himself
> instead a late 11.30 ‘breakfast’ of soup and two ham sandwiches, with
> ‘vegetarian’ bread and a simple meat dish in the afternoon: a diet which
> seems to have worked wonders for most of 1874.
