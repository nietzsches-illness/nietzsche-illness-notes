# Jan 1871: Intestines hemorrhoids

> Nietzsche’s agonized despondency had, by late January, plumbed an absolutely
> shattering depth. On 6 February he informed his mother that his state of ill-
> health, now marked by dreadful insomnia, stomach, intestinal and
> haemorthoidal pains, had so deteriorated that the two university doctors who
> had examined him had put him on a Karlsbad water cure. He needed a change of
> scene and it was imperative, he wrote, that he leave Basel and seek the ‘more
> southern air’ of Italy.  Nietzsche was almost certainly suffering from an
> ulcerated stomach, brought on by the nervous tension which Wilhelm Vischer’s
> silence (about his request for Teichmiiller’s philosophical chair) had raised
> to a peak of intolerable acuteness. His tormented state of mind was clearly
> reflected in this letter, in which, like a pleading child, he asked if his
> mother or his sister could accompany him southwards — only to add that he
> could perfectly well make the trip alone!
