# Dec 1879: Deterioration 118 attack days in year

> Meanwhile Fritz’s health had been deteriorating rapidly, so excessive had
> been the strain imposed on his weak eyes by the imperatives of proof-
> reading. His sister Elisabeth, who could have helped him, was at this moment
> keeping house for a friend near the Swiss town of Chur. The first week of
> December was mostly spent in bed, with fits of vomiting accompanying the
> violent headaches. Heavy snowfalls made it difficult for him to maintain his
> daily routine of long, nerve-calming walks, and shortly after Christmas he
> suffered a major three-day collapse, during which he actually passed out.
> ‘Never,’ Fritz wrote to his sister on 28 December, ‘have I observed such a
> regular worsening of my condition as in the past three months.’ The next day,
> in a note thanking Elisabeth for the handsome trunk she had thoughtfully
> given the ‘errant fugitive’ for Christmas, he added sadly: ‘During the past
> year I had 118 serious nervous- attack days. Lovely statistic!”
