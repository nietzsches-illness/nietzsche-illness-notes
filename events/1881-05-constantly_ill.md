# May 1881: Constantly ill

> The four weeks spent at Recoaro proved to be a trying time for both ‘master’
> and ‘devoted disciple’. Nietzsche was almost constantly ill, fretfully
> frustrated by the slowness with which a new Leipzig printer (Teubner) kept
> sending them the proofs of Morgenrote, and by the absence of nearby forests
> for the well-shaded walks his head and eyes so badly needed. Késelitz, for
> his part, was so engrossed by his work of orchestral composition that he
> spent much of each day in his bedroom.
