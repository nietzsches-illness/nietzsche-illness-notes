# July 1879: Bed every second day

> immediate improvement in his physical condition. To his mother in Naumburg he
> wrote that the ‘woods, lakes, the finest footpaths, as they must be laid out
> for someone almost blind like me, and the most bracing air — the best in
> Europe — make me love this place. Yet I am ill here, as elsewhere, just as I
> was in the autumn in Naumburg; having to lie down and stay in bed every
> second day. But I endure it here much better, whereas elsewhere, particularly
> in Basel, I was on the very verge of desperation.’
