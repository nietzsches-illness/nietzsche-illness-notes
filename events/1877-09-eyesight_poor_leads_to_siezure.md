# Sept 1877: Eyesight poor leads to siezure

> reading to her brother in the evening. For, as Nietzsche had explained in a
> letter written to Franz Overbeck shortly after leaving Rosenlauibad, on the
> basis of careful chronometric testing, ‘I have roughly one and a half hours
> of eyesight to spend each day . . . If I read or write for longer than that,
> I have to atone the same day with pains and several days thereafter with the
> old familiar seizure.”
