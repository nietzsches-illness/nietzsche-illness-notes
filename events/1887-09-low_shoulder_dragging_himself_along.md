# Sept 1887: Low shoulder dragging himself along

> For Nietzsche it was a joy to take his visitors on a guided tour of his
> favourite Alpine spots. But Deussen could not help noticing how much his
> friend had changed. Gone was the ‘proud posture, the elastic gait and the
> fluent speech of yore’. With one shoulder slightly lower than the other,
> Nietzsche seemed to have trouble ‘dragging himself along’ and finding the
> proper words for what he wanted to say.This may not have been one of his
> ‘good days’, for at one point he waved at some passing clouds and said, ‘I
> must have blue sky overhead to be able to collect my thoughts.’ What most
> distressed Deussen, however, was the visit he was allowed to make to
> Nietzsche’s ‘den’, which he found in a state of deplorable disorder — with
> eggshells and a coffee-cup next to toilet articles and manuscript pages,
> loosely scattered over the rustic table and, beyond an upright boot-jack,
> over the sheets of an unmade bed.
