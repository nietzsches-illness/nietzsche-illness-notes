# Aug 1879: Unable to leave bed

> Sustained by the dried plums and prunes, the tins of tongue, the packets of
> cornmeal, the jars of fish which the generous Louise Rothpletz kept sending
> him from Ziirich, Nietzsche spent three months holed up in a little house —
> the hotels of St Moritz being much too expensive. By mid- August his feeling
> of solitude had grown so unbearable that he sent a pathetic postcard to
> Overbeck, who, sensing his friend’s profound despondency, left his wife’s
> family in Ziirich and journeyed all the way to St Moritz. He found Nietzsche
> lodged in a tiny room and in such a state of prostration that he could not
> leave his bed and accompany Overbeck on his walks up and down the valley.
