# Nov 1876: Recurrent eye head aches

> Just as Wagner's flight from Bayreuth failed to bring him the peace of mind
> he had hoped to find in Italy, so Nietzsche’s much longer ‘flight from Basel’
> offered him scant relief from the recurrent eye-aches and headaches he so
> desperately craved. More loving care and motherly
