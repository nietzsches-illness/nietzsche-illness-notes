# June 1885: Headaches seizure bad month

> serious intellectual dissatisfaction. He was afflicted by blinding headaches
> and was finally felled by a week-long seizure. After the ‘angelically’
> patient Frau Réder had returned to Ziirich in early July, Nietzsche made no
> attempt to conceal his feeling of relief. This experiment, he wrote to
> K6selitz, was not one he was ready to renew. Everything he had dictated to
> Frau Réder was ‘worthless’. He had found her unstable, and too prone to weep
> over her present lot. ‘But worst of all: she has no manners, and  swings her
> legs. Nevertheless, she helped me to get through a bad month, with the very
> best of dispositions.”
