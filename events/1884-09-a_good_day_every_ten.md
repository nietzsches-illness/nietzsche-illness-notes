# Sep 1884: A good day every ten

> Four days after Heinrich von Stein’s departure, Nietzsche wrote to Resa von
> Schirnhofer — very much a prospective member of the gaya scienza ‘club’ — to
> say that at Sils-Maria the frost had set in with a biting, ‘blue-finger
> cold’, which was adversely affecting his health. Heinrich von Stein’s visit,
> however, had done him a world of good — ‘at last a man with a fundamentally
> heroic disposition, beautifully brought up in R. W[agner]’s entourage to
> reverence, completely different from the way people are now brought up (that
> is, to talk and chatter about everything to everybody).’  To Késelitz, in a
> letter written the same day, he admitted that his health had not been good —
> ‘it was better in Venice, and even better in Nice. Every ten days a good day:
> so says my statistic, to the devil with it! . .. No one to read to me! Every
> evening seized by melancholy in this low-ceilinged room, shivering with cold,
> and waiting 3-4 hours for permission fo go to bed.”
