# Mar 1885: Dark glasses eyes watering

> put out by this sudden, but alas so typical ‘flight’, Nietzsche finally
> decided to join his devoted ‘disciple’ in Venice. It had the immense
> advantage over all the other Italian cities he had visited of having dark,
> well-paved streets and alleyways where, weak-sighted as he was, he ran no
> risk of being run over by a passing carriage. His eyes, despite a pair of
> dark-lensed spectacles, were now constantly watering and, to his acute
> embarrassment, tears he could not control often rolled down his cheeks.
